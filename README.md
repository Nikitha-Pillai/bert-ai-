This project focuses on detecting phishing emails using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art NLP model. 
The system performs binary text classification, where emails are categorized as phishing (1) or legitimate (0) based on their subject and body content.
The dataset is preprocessed to clean text, remove duplicates, and balance labels. 
Using 5-fold cross-validation, the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
With an accuracy of around 94.6%, the model demonstrates robust performance in understanding linguistic patterns associated with phishing. 
This makes it a reliable foundation for integrating into real-world email security systems to enhance user protection.
